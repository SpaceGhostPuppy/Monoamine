When examining the sequence of Mephedrone → Ketamine → Mephedrone, several important pharmacological interactions could occur:

Mephedrone primarily acts as a monoamine releaser, causing a flood of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine into synapses. 

Ketamine's primary mechanism is NMDA receptor antagonism, but it does have secondary effects on monoamine systems.
From a neurobiological perspective, when ketamine is introduced after mephedrone, there may be a temporary modulation of the excessive monoamine activity. 

However, this doesn't "reset" the system - rather, it creates a complex neurochemical state where multiple mechanisms are disrupted simultaneously.

When additional mephedrone is introduced after ketamine, several concerning mechanisms could occur:

The already taxed monoamine system would face additional pressure to release more neurotransmitters
Any temporary modulation from ketamine would be overwhelmed
The combination could potentially lead to more severe serotonergic effects

This pattern could indeed create a more intense reaction than either substance alone, potentially increasing serotonin syndrome risk. 
The staggered timing might actually be more dangerous than simultaneous consumption in some ways.

To explain in more straightforward terms:
When someone takes mephedrone, it forces the brain to release large amounts of chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Think of it like opening the floodgates of these mood-regulating chemicals.
When ketamine is taken after mephedrone, it doesn't simply "undo" or "reset" what the mephedrone did. Instead, it's like adding another substance that disrupts brain chemistry in a different way. 

While ketamine might temporarily seem to modify the intense effects of mephedrone, it's actually creating a more complicated situation where multiple brain systems are now being affected simultaneously.
If someone then takes more mephedrone after the ketamine, three main things can happen:

The brain's chemical system is already strained from the first dose of mephedrone - adding more is like asking an exhausted runner to sprint again
Any apparent calming effect from the ketamine would be overwhelmed by the new flood of chemicals
This combination could potentially trigger more severe reactions, particularly related to too much serotonin in the system (serotonin syndrome)

If you've already revved an engine to its limits once, let it sputter a bit while still running hot, and then rev it again - you're more likely to cause damage than if you'd just let it cool down completely first.
From a harm reduction perspective, this pattern of usage significantly increases risk rather than reducing it.

MDMA and mephedrone (4-MMC) affect the monoamine system differently:
MDMA primarily targets serotonin, causing massive serotonin release while having less impact on dopamine and norepinephrine. This creates the empathogenic and entactogenic effects MDMA is known for. The serotonin system is particularly vulnerable to depletion and takes much longer to recover compared to other neurotransmitter systems.
Mephedrone (4-MMC), in contrast, has a more balanced effect across serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems. While it does release serotonin, it has proportionally stronger effects on dopamine release compared to MDMA. This creates a more stimulant-like effect profile.

Regarding why MDMA can't be safely redosed as frequently:
The main reason MDMA shouldn't be redosed frequently is because it rapidly depletes serotonin reserves in the brain. When you take MDMA, it causes neurons to release large amounts of stored serotonin all at once. The brain cannot quickly replenish these serotonin stores, which takes days to weeks to fully recover.
When someone attempts to redose MDMA frequently:

There's simply less serotonin available to release with each subsequent dose
The body increases production of neurotoxic metabolites like HHA and HMA
Body temperature regulation becomes more impaired, increasing hyperthermia risk
Oxidative stress increases, potentially causing more neurotoxicity
Tolerance develops rapidly, leading to diminishing effects

In contrast, while mephedrone also depletes neurotransmitters, its stronger action on the dopamine system means it can sometimes produce effects even after serotonin is depleted. However, this absolutely doesn't make frequent redosing safe - it simply means the subjective effects might still be perceived due to dopamine activity while the serotonin system continues to be stressed.

Several serotonin antagonists exist that may be used medically for serotonin syndrome:

Cyproheptadine (Periactin) is the most commonly used serotonin antagonist for treating serotonin syndrome in medical settings. It's considered first-line pharmacological treatment for moderate to severe cases.
Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) has both antiserotonergic and antidopaminergic properties and has been used in some severe cases, particularly when agitation is significant.
Olanzapine has been reported in some case studies to help with serotonin syndrome due to its 5-HT2A antagonism.
Mirtazapine, though primarily used as an antidepressant, has 5-HT2A antagonist properties that might theoretically help in certain cases.
